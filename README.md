# my-little-journal

purpose?
- for me to write stories of my own and save them with my own custom formatting.
- A good program enables and encourages creation (not causes issues and technological failures).

- why poassword protect the contents from the server?
- A practice but honestly I forget the reason and just know I have to do it that way.

- how to prevent this from becoming another social media website?
- Because this is for me to enable my writing style and techniques. It's open for everyone to see but no one will find it because no one will go looking there. The point is practice and this is all to make my life easier.
